# Guess The Flag Game

## Repository
https://github.com/IvyShertzer/ShertzerIvy_FinalProject.git

## Description

I want to code a visual game that will give the player a random flag, and have the player guess the country of the flag. Each time the player guesses the flag wrong, the game gives the player a hint. This project will help me understand interactive games and basic game loops better, and also help me learn how to code games with computer art/graphics.

## Features
- Feature 1
    - Code will pick random country along with the country flag and 5 random correlating hints
- Feature 2
    - Present the player with a text box to type a guess/input
- Feature 3
    - If the player guesses wrong, the game presents a hint (max 5 guesses)
- Feature 4
    - if the player guesses wrong 5 times, they loose, if they guess right before then, they win and can choose to replay or quit.

## Challenges

- How to draw a typable text box on the game screen, that also takes user input.
- How to make clickable buttons on the game screen
- How to pick a random topic with correlating image and lists.
- How to have a game replay from the beginning and ressetting all the code.

## Outcomes

Ideal Outcome:
- I create the game fully how I imagine it with atleast 6 random countries

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- I create a game with just one flag you have to guess the name of, along with hints and player income.
